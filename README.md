# Book Reading App

### Problem Statement:

Over a great period, many issues have been faced by our enthusiastic fictional and non fictional books readers . One of the challenges they face every day is to find the books which they need to read in single place. Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

### Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a “Books reading application” to keep a plothera of books at one place and provides all the information about books they need to study. Its features include buying a particular book button and also gives a button to read in at the spot . It accepts student data allowing them to register to the application. Currently the app works for Army institute of technology, Pune, students only. The project's scope is to extend it for other institutions to books reading in future in collaboration.

### Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their favourite books. 
Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :-
- Linear layout: LinearLayout is a view group that aligns all children in a single direction, vertically or horizontally.
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Drawer Layout : Drawer Layout is the root layout in which we define a FrameLayout and a Navigation View. In Navigation View we set the items from menu file and FrameLayout is used to replace the Fragments on the click of menu items.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- Recycler View : To present the list of different route busses we used the efficient recyclerview.
- Card View : CardView is a new widget in Android that can be used to display any sort of data by providing a rounded corner layout along with a specific elevation. CardView is the view that can display views on top of each other.
As of now the app does not have internet connectivity but in the future updates it will have it.
